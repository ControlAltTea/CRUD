![CRUD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ControlAltTea/CRUD/main/images/crudapp.gif?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABWT7UCMWFX2GQJN27FUPN4OYW4KFSQ)

I created a  "User Management" system to log fake (or APPLICABLE!) user information to a MongoDB cluster.


## Installation

Install CRUD with npm


```bash
  npm install CRUD
  cd CRUD
```

## Tech Used : ![HTML](https://img.shields.io/badge/-HTML-orange?style=for-the-badge&logo=appveyor)![CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/-CSS-green?style=for-the-badge&logo=appveyor)![Javascript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Javascript-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=appveyor)

Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, users are able to create their own logged information, including names, email, gender, and active (or inactive) status.
